# How to install Java universal guide (JRE, JDK and OpenJDK)
In this tutorial we will explore how to install Java - both JRE and JDK, for Windows, Mac and Linux.

# JRE vs JDK basic info

The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment. It is a package of everything necessary to run or execute a compiled Java program, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, the java command, and other infrastructure. However, it cannot be used to create new programs.

The JDK is the Java Development Kit, the full-featured SDK (Software Development Kit) for Java. It has everything the JRE has, but also the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). It is capable of creating, compiling and executing programs.

Usually, if you only care about running Java programs on computer you will only install the JRE. It's all you need. On the other hand, if you are planning to do some Java programming, you need to install the JDK instead. 

JDK is a superset of JRE, and contains everything that is in JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications. JRE provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.
